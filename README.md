# Payroll Management System
This Payroll Management System is a comprehensive Java project that demonstrates the application of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system is designed to manage employee payroll efficiently, with the following key features:

OOP Design: The system is built using fundamental OOP principles, including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Abstract Classes and Inheritance: The project uses abstract classes and concrete subclasses to implement inheritance, enabling a structured and hierarchical design.

Encapsulation and Abstraction: Proper encapsulation and abstraction are utilized to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary functionalities.

Polymorphism and Method Overriding: The system demonstrates polymorphism and method overriding to provide flexible and reusable code.

Terminal-Based User Interface: A simple and intuitive terminal-based user interface is implemented to facilitate user interaction.

Salary Calculation: The system calculates salaries for both Full-Time and Part-Time employees using abstract methods, ensuring that each employee type is handled appropriately.

Employee Management: The system allows for the addition, updating, and removal of employee records, making it easy to manage payroll data.

This project serves as a practical example of how OOP concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems in Java, offering a solid foundation for further exploration and development.
